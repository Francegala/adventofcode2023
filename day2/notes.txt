small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue
Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes 
of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information 
about the number of cubes.

Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 
12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. 
What is the sum of the IDs of those games?


in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?
