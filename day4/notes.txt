The next thing you notice is an Elf sitting on the floor across the 
station in what seems to be a pile of colorful square cards.

Picking one up, it looks like each card has two lists 
of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|):

a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have.

you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear 
in the list of winning numbers. 
The first match makes the card worth one point 
and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.

part 2
Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal 
to the number of matches. 
So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
